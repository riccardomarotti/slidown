# Slidown

Sort of a Deckset clone, built upon Reveal.js and Pandoc

Slidown should allow to do everything you can do with
[Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js), with an interface inspired to
[Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/).

Conversions are made with [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).

Still not released... here's a little preview:
